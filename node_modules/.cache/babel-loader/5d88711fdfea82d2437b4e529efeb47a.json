students to think creatively and analytically in an engaging way?</p>\n                                <p>Since the beginning, Whooo’s Reading has been very good at helping teachers track their students’ independent reading and motivating students to read more on their own. While Whooo’s Reading did a good job managing and motivating independent reading, we discovered that teachers and schools were most interested in WR because of the questions that ask students about the books they read.</p>\n                                <img src={ comprehension } alt=\"\"/>\n\n                                <p>We learned that teachers were fed up with the factual-recall multiple choice questions that programs would ask students.</p>\n                                <img src={ multipleChoice } alt=\"\"/>\n                                <p>Questions like these do not prepare students for a world in which they need to think creatively and analytically and one in which they can easily google the answer to fact-recall questions. Moreover the new standards ask students to synthesize, cite evidence, analyze, and write and these ‘old-school’ multiple choice assessments were not cutting it anymore. </p>\n                                <p>As a result, we realized that the best way we could continue to help teachers with our program was by improving our reading questions and assessment content.
