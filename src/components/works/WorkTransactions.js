          <p>
            Case managers encountered difficulties in efficiently tracking services provided to their constituents 
            that involved funding-related aspects, as our Service Tracker (existing system) lacked the capacity to 
            manage financial services and associated workflows. Additionally, admins needed a way to approve 
            obligations and expenses across different case managers, adding another layer of complexity to the workflow.  
          </p>
          <p>
            With multiple steps required, including tracking service details, obtaining approvals, 
            transitioning from obligation to expense, and securing subsequent approvals, there was a need for 
            a streamlined method to manage these tasks seamlessly.

            Managing the lifecycle of an obligation or expense involves several stages that can 
            pose challenges in maintaining a seamless workflow. These Stages are:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Creating an obligation from the service
              </li>
              <li>The ability to edit/approve the obligation</li>
              <li>Submitting the obligation as an expense (after obligation is approved) after money has been spent</li>
              <li>The ability to edit/approve the expense</li>
              <li>The ability (by anyone) to mark the task as done</li>
            </ol>
            I used a variety of methods to determine what the teacherâ€™s
            experience would look like. Each method had a slightly different
            approach.

                            Balancing these various states and flow presented a significant

                                In the initial approach, the idea was to present obligations, expenses, and 
                                their respective statuses (pending, rejected, approved) as toggles above the data table for visibility. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                However, navigating through multiple toggles to ascertain the status of each item 
                                proved to be cumbersome and inefficient. This method lacked clarity and made it 
                                difficult to quickly determine the current situation and status of an obligation or expense. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We needed to explore alternative solutions that could provide a more intuitive 
                                and streamlined interface for managing the various transactions.
                            </p>

                        <div>
                            <p>
                               In refining the interface, we retained the toggle concept but restructured it to provide clearer 
                               direction and reduce nesting. Instead of burying options within 
                               multiple layers (e.g., expenses > pending), we elevated key 
                               actions and statuses to the external level, making them more 
                               accessible and intuitive for users. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                               This approach ensured that case managers could easily identify and interact with 
                               obligations, expenses, and their corresponding statuses without navigating 
                               through complex layers of toggles. Simplifying the interface and bringing 
                               critical elements to the forefront, improved the experience of managing tasks 
                               and tracking statuses within the Transactions Tracker.

                            Internally, we favoured the simplicity of the table view for its straightforward presentation of transactional data.

                                However, we opted for a left/right layout that combined the visual appeal of cards 
                                with the functionality of a detailed view. This layout enabled case managers to 
                                simultaneously view transactional information and take actions without 
                                navigating to another page or opening a modal.

                                However, admins would have a table view that would allow them to perform 
                                batch actions and efficiently manage transactions across different case managers.
