          <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
          <p>
            The Whooo's Reading platform is a higher-level thinking alternative
            to multiple choice. Students write responses to open-ended questions
            about books they have read. Students re-associate reading with joy
            as they do good work and enjoy the gamified elements throughout the
            site.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to helping teachers track their students’ independent
            reading and writing, Whooo’s reading also provides a significant
            amount of data on work students have completed.
          </p>
          <p>
            We heard from many teachers that they enjoyed the data experience.
            However, we wanted to re-explore this experience for two reasons:
            <ol>
              <li>We knew of usability issues that needed to be fixed. </li>
              <li>

                really wanted and how we could better serve their data needs.

          The following were the three most common usability issues I heard from
          our users:
          <ol>
            <li>
              On the dashboard, teachers wanted to be able to view all of their
              students across all of their classes. They currently had to spend
              time toggling through each class.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teachers consistently complained that we did not have certain
              types of data. Most of the time we indeed had the data but they
              were unable to find it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Teachers wanted to be able to sort quantitative data with filters
              such as “top” and “bottom” performers.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

          <li>We had the right data.</li>
          <li>We needed to improve usability.</li>
          <li>
            Teachers were overwhelmingly most concerned with qualitative data
            (i.e. quiz answers), not quantitative data (i.e. number of questions
            answered).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    );

  renderConcept() {

          <p className="all-caps news-sub-heading">concept</p>
          <p>
            As shown above, our data experience comprised two pages: Teacher
            Dashboard and Data Page. It highlighted the quantitative and
            qualitative student data available to teachers. The dashboard had a
            table showing student progress toward goals set by the teacher and
            the data page was where teachers could really dive into all of their
            data.
          </p>
          <img className="full-width" src={dashboardOld} alt="old-dashboard" />
          <img className="full-width lessMargin" src={dataOld} alt="old-data" />
          <p>
            I wanted to keep the data page as the hub of the data experience
            while showing more types of data and summaries on the teacher
            dashboard. This would put more of a focus on reading comprehension
            (qualitative data), enhance the discovery of our data features, and
            make the data experience lighter and more visual.
          </p>
          <p>
            The data page needed to be “flattened out” and simplified. The
            experience was cumbersome for a few reasons:
            <ol>
              <li>
                <span>
                  Each data type (in the dropdown) had numerous subtypes.
                </span>
              </li>
              <li>
                There were too many clicks to find what you were looking for (in
                general and because of the usability issues mentioned earlier).
              </li>
              <li>
                The filter dropdowns (controls) made the layout feel denser than
                it was because of how inward facing it was. It felt like you
                were tunnelling deeper and deeper into the data interface and
                was easy to feel lost in.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

              New Relic has a really insightful dashboard. The snippets of your

            <p>
              Class Dojo has students laid out simply on the left and clicking
              on them brings up their information on the right. This already
              felt like a simpler and more frictionless way to display the
              student controls.

              Both New Relic and Class Dojo’s controls were wider and filled in
              (the space above the control on hover and click). This made their
              controls feel a lot more friendly and satisfying to use.

          <p>
            The new layout took the categories from the dropdown and abstracted
            them out into top level tabs. Each tab is a different data category
            and has subtypes within it below. This reduced the number of data
            subtypes shown (at any time) to less than five and made the controls
            and flow feel much lighter. This consolidation lightened the
            experience enough that we were able to add a new category as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of finding students within a dropdown, students were brought
            out to the surface level (on the left) and displayed openly.
            Although there was now a little less room for the data content on
            the right, it was much easier to toggle through classes and students
            and made the experience feel lighter and less tunnelled.
