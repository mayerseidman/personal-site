          <h3>BACKGROUND</h3>
          <p>
            Since the beginning, Whooo's Reading (WR) has been great at helping
            teachers track their students' independent reading and motivating
            students to read more on their own. While WHooo's Reading did a good
            job managing and motivating independent reading, we discovered that
            teachers and schools were most interested in WR because of the
            questions that ask students about the books the read.
          </p>
          <p>
            Teachers were fed up with the factual-recall multiple choice
            questions that programs would ask students. These questions do not
            prepare students for a world in which they need to think creatively
            and analytically and one in which they can easily google the answer
            to fact-recall questions. Moreover, the new standards ask students
            to synthesize, cite evidence, analyze, and write and these
            ‘old-school’ multiple choice assessments were not cutting it
            anymore.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way to help teachers with our program was to improve our
            reading questions and assessment content. To make these
            improvements, we turned to our teachers for their invaluable
            feedback and input.

                  I might have a student who is missing a particular skill:
                  maybe inferring, drawing conclusions, answering open-ended
                  questions, main ideas, supporting details, using evidence. The
                  way I currently handle this is to introduce a concept to the
                  whole class(e.g main ideas) then do a lesson on the concept.
                  Then I break them into groups of 4, so they can start getting
                  practice, and so they can give support to each other
                </p>

                <p>
                  The worst part of this process is coming up with activities
                  for the 3 or 4 person groups and grading them. My expertise is
                  in teaching the lesson and helping groups and students
                  understand what was taught. I want to hand off coming up with
                  ways to practice the reading skills.

                While some sites (e.g. Pinterest) offer graphic organizers and
                other forms of assessments-- it often takes many hours to find
                the right types of reading exercises, and they are rarely
                engaging for students. In fact nearly very teacher we spoke to
                brought up some version of this problem

                  My time is so limited. At the beginning of the year, you have

            more clarity into the components in our system that were a part of
            this job and the relationships and interactions that would be
            required to facilitate it.

                Some teachers had trouble finding the exercises they wanted. We
                came up with several ideas of potential filters:
              </p>
              <p>
                Filter exercises by learning type (visual, audible, reading,
                etc) Filter exercises by prior reading vs. text provided in
                exercise Filter exercises by time estimate Filter exercises by
                traditional (mostly writing) vs. reward (more creative) Filter
                exercises by difficulty level

            <div className="bottom-content">
              <b>CONSTRAINTS</b>
              <p>
                Teachers often have 20 or 30 students in their assignment
                progress table, and maybe only assign 2 exercises. This would
                create a pretty big discrepancy between the height of the
                assignments box and the height of the progress table-making it a
                bit of an awkward experience.

              <b>WORDING</b>
              <p>
                In the assignment creation, the word "delete" was confusing as
                it seemed to imply that doing so would delete the exercises
                (instead of merely deleting the assignment).

                To start, we only supported the ability to assign exercises to
                all of a teacher's students at once. There was already a lot of
                interest in being able to assign groups of students different
                exercises.

            After hearing teachers talk about their use of Pinterest again, I
            decided that we should use their knowledge of that interface to our
            advantage. By mimicking aspects of that interface we could make
            their experience on Whooo's Reading that much smoother.
          </p>
          <p>
            The loading animation, buttons and thumbnail image on each exercise
            were all designed to orient users to their experience on Pinterest.
            I also decided to simplify it and remove the "inactive" exercises
            section. Meaning, that outside of assignments, teachers would not be
            able to control the exercises students do (on their own).
